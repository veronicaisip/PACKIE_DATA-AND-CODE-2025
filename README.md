## General info
PACKIE is a Python-based travel packing list generator designed to help users prepare for trips by creating a customised list based on destination, weather type, and travel dates. The project integrates Flask as the backend and Tkinter as the GUI, running together through the threading module within a single file. Creating a simple desktop application ready for immediate use.  

## Features 
* User-input travel details
* Weather categorised packing recommendatiosn
* Trip duration calculated using Datetime
* Interactive Tkinter frontend
* Flask backend logic using POST requests 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.0
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* Flask - Requests, jsonify 
* Tkinter - tkFont, tkCalendar, ttk, messagebox 
* Datetime
* Time
* Threading 
	
## Setup
There are two ways to run the file. Ensure all required modules are installed first Python, Flask and Tkinter

1. (Recommended) Download the code file, open code within Microsoft Visual Studio Code and run it. Application opens on your main desktop.

2. Download code file, ensure it is in an accessible folder. Run the following script in terminal:

```
python3 PACKIE.py
```
Tkinter Interface should open, while Flask runs in the background locally. (If this second method doesn't work please refer to 1.)
